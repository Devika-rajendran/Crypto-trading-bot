# Crypto Trading Bot (Junior Python Developer Assignment)

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based **Crypto Trading Bot** developed as part of the *Junior Python Developer – Crypto Trading Bot* assignment.  
The project focuses on designing a clean, modular trading bot architecture with logging, strategy handling, and exchange integration readiness.

Although full live trading execution could not be completed due to **API key creation restrictions on the exchange**, the core structure, logic, and workflow of the bot have been implemented and demonstrated.

- Configuration-based design (API keys externalized)
- Error handling and debugging support
- Code written with exchange API integration in mind

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Streamlit** (for UI / visualization)
- **REST API integration design**
- **Python logging module**
- **Git & GitHub**
